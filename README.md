# Daves-Hot-Dice
Dice Game made for Bitmaker front-end web development course.

Based on pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  No frameworks (except font-awesome for their amazing hamburger icon).

Allows user to set their bet, and roll the dice.  On 4-6 the user wins their bet, on a 1-3 user loses their bet.  Bank roll will update as rolls continue

Set up error handling if user tries to bet more then their bank roll, or if the user tries to roll the dice with a bet greater then their bank roll.

4-23-2018: added mobile responsiveness, added reset button that appears when user runs out of money they resets game to default state.
